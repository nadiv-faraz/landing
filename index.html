            <h2>Waste Management</h2>
            <p>
                In today's fast-paced and consumer-driven world, the issue of food waste has become a significant concern. The global food waste crisis not only contributes to environmental degradation but also poses ethical and economic challenges. In light of these issues, the Food Manager app emerges as a revolutionary solution, introducing an innovative feature known as Waste Management.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding the Food Waste Problem:</h3>
            <p>
                The scale of food waste is staggering, with millions of tons of edible food discarded annually across the globe. This wasteful practice not only squanders valuable resources like water, energy, and land but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as the discarded food decomposes in landfills. Furthermore, it perpetuates a cycle of overproduction and overconsumption, exacerbating food insecurity and hunger in some regions.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The Food Manager's Approach:
            </h3>

            <p>
                In a bid to address this critical problem, the Food Manager app incorporates a sophisticated Waste Management feature. This feature takes a proactive stance in preventing food waste by offering timely reminders to users about the impending expiration dates of their stored food items.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Timely Expiry Reminders:
            </h3>

            <p>
                One of the primary causes of food waste in households is the neglect of food items nearing their expiration dates. The Waste Management feature of the Food Manager app tackles this issue head-on by sending users timely notifications, alerting them when their groceries are on the brink of expiration. This ensures that users are consistently aware of the status of their food inventory and can plan their meals accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Customizable Alerts and Notifications:
            </h3>

            <p>
                The app goes a step further by allowing users to customize their alert preferences. Users can set parameters such as how far in advance they want to be notified before an item expires, enabling them to plan meals effectively and reduce unnecessary food waste. This personalized approach empowers users to take control of their consumption patterns and contribute to the global effort to mitigate food waste.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Encouraging Responsible Consumption:
            </h3>

            <p>
                Beyond mere reminders, the Food Manager app incorporates educational elements to foster a sense of responsibility among users. Through informative content and tips on smart shopping and meal planning, the app encourages users to make mindful choices, thereby reducing the overall volume of food waste generated.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Environmental Impact:
            </h3>

            <p>
                By addressing the issue of food waste at its source, the Food Manager app not only benefits individual users but also contributes to a broader environmental impact. The reduction in food waste translates to a decrease in the environmental footprint associated with food production, transportation, and disposal.
